  description: |
    PyMOL is computer software, a molecular visualization system created by Warren Lyford DeLano. It is user-sponsored,
    open-source software, released under the Python License. It was commercialized initially by DeLano Scientific LLC,
    which was a private software company dedicated to creating useful tools that become universally accessible to
    scientific and educational communities. It is currently commercialized by Schr√∂dinger, Inc. PyMOL can produce
    high-quality 3D images of small molecules and biological macromolecules, such as proteins. According to the original
    author, by 2009, almost a quarter of all published images of 3D protein structures in the scientific literature were
    made using PyMOL.
