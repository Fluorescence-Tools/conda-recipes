This repository contains inputs to build 'conda' packages for the Anaconda Python distribution.

The resulting packages are uploaded to Anaconda.org (formerly Binstar) to the repository 'tpeulen'.

In the recipes were built using 'conda build recipename'.

    64-bit Linux packages are built in a Debian WSL environment (Debian Strech, 9.6).
    64-bit Mac packages are built on our 10.9 system (see the build directory for our setup script).
    64-bit Windows packages are built in a 64-bit Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2017.
